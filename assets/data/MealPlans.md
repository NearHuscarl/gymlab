# Paleo

The paleo diet claims that modern humans should eat the same foods that their hunter-gatherer ancestors ate — the way humans were genetically designed to eat before agriculture developed.

The theory is that most modern diseases can be linked to the Western diet and the consumption of grains, dairy and processed foods.

While it's debatable that this diet is comprised of the same foods your ancestors ate, it is linked to several impressive health benefits.

## How it works

The paleo diet emphasizes whole foods, lean protein, vegetables, fruits, nuts and seeds, while avoiding processed foods, sugar, dairy and grains.

Some more flexible versions of the paleo diet also allow for dairy like cheese and butter, as well as tubers like potatoes and sweet potatoes.

## Weight loss

Several studies have shown that the paleo diet can lead to significant weight loss and reduced waist size.

In studies, paleo dieters have also been shown to automatically eat much fewer carbs, more protein and 300-900 fewer calories per day.

## Other benefits

The diet seems effective at reducing risk factors for heart disease, such as cholesterol, blood sugar, blood triglycerides and blood pressure.

## The downside

The paleo diet eliminates whole grains, legumes and dairy.

Therefore, it unnecessarily eliminates several healthy and nutritious food groups.

## Eat

**Meats:** Beef, lamb, chicken, turkey, pork, and others

**Fish and Seafood:** Salmon, trout, haddock, shrimp, shellfish, etc. Choose wild-caught if you can.

**Eggs:** Choose free-range, pastured or omega-3 enriched eggs.

**Vegetables:** Broccoli, kale, peppers, onions, carrots, tomatoes, etc.

**Fruits:** Apples, bananas, oranges, pears, avocados,  strawberries, blueberries, avocados and more.

**Tubers:** Potatoes, sweet potatoes, yams,
turnips, etc.

**Nuts and Seeds:** Almonds, macadamia nuts, walnuts, hazelnuts, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds and more

**Healthy Fats and Oils:** Extra virgin olive oil, coconut oil, avocado oil and others.

**Salt and Spices:** Sea salt, Himalayan salt, garlic, turmeric, rosemary, etc.

## Avoid

**Sugar and High Fructose Corn Syrup:**  Soft drinks, fruit juices, table sugar, candy, pastries, ice cream and many others.

**Grains:** Includes bread and pasta, wheat, spelt, rye, barley, etc.

**Legumes:** Beans, lentils and many more.

**Dairy:** Avoid most dairy, especially low-fat
(some versions of paleo do include full-fat dairies like butter and cheese).

**Vegetable Oils:** Soybean oil, sunflower oil, cottonseed oil, corn oil, grapeseed oil, safflower oil and others.

**Trans Fats:** Found in margarine and various processed foods. Usually referred to as "hydrogenated" or "partially hydrogenated" oils.

**Artificial Sweeteners:** Aspartame, Suoralose, Cyclamates, Saccharin, Acesulfame Potassium. Use natural sweeteners instead.

**Highly Processed Foods:** Everything labelled "diet" or "low-fat" or has many weird ingredients. Includes artificial meal replacements.

# Vegan

The vegan diet was created by a group of vegetarians who also chose not to consume dairy, eggs or any other animal products.
The vegan way of life attempts to exclude all forms of animal exploitation and cruelty for ethical, environmental or health reasons.

## How it works

Veganism is the strictest form of vegetarianism.

In addition to eliminating meat, it eliminates dairy, eggs and animal-derived products, such as gelatin, honey, albumin, whey, casein and some forms of vitamin D3.

## Weight loss

A vegan diet seems to be very effective at helping people lose weight, often without counting calories. This may be explained by its very low fat and high fiber content, which makes you feel fuller for longer.

Vegan diets have consistently been linked to lower body weight and body mass index (DNA), compared to other diets.
One study showed that a vegan diet helped participants lose 9.3 lbs (4.2 kg) more than a control diet over 18 weeks. The vegan group was allowed to eat until fullness, but the control group had to restrict calories.

However, vegan diets are not more effective for
weight loss than other diets when matched for

## Other benefits

Plant-based diets have been linked with a reduced risk of heart disease, type 2 diabetes and premature death.

Limiting processed meat may also reduce your risk of developing Alzheimer's disease and dying from heart disease or cancer.

## The downside

Vegan diets eliminate animal foods completely, so they may be low in severaal nutrients. This includes vitamin B12, vitamin D, iodine, iron, calcium, zinc and omega-3 fatty acids

## Eat

**Tofu, tempeh and seitan:** These provide a versatile protein-rich alternative to meat, fish, poultry and eggs in many recipes.

**Legumes:** Foods such as beans, lentils and peas are excellent sources of many nutrients and beneficial plant compounds. Sprouting, fermenting and proper cooking can increase nutrient absorption.

**Nuts and nut butter:** Especially unblanched and unreasted varieties, which are good source of iron, fiber, magnesium zinc, selenium and vitamin E.

**Seeds:** Especially hemp, chia and flaxseeds, which contain a good amount of protein and beneficial omega-3 fatty acids.

**Calcium-fortified plant milk and yoghurt:** These help vegans achieve their recommended dietary calcium intakes. Opt for varieties also fortified with vitamins B12 and D whenever possible.

**Algae:** Spirulina and chlorella are good sources of complete protein. Other varieties are great sources of iodine.

**Nutritional yeast:** This is an easy way to increase the protein content of vegan dishes and add an interesting cheesy flavuor. Pick vitamin B12-fortified varieties whenever possible

**Whole grains, cereals and pseudocereals:** These are a great source of complex carbs, fiber, iron, B-vitamins and several minerals. Spelt, teff amaranth and quinoa are especially high-protein options.

**Sprouter and fermented plant food:** Ezekiel, bread, tempeh, miso, natto, sauerkraut, pickles, kimchi and kombucha often contain probiotics and vitamin K2. Sprouting and fermenting can help improve mineral absorption.

**Ftuits and vegetables:** Both are great foods to increase your nutrient intake. Leafy greens such as bok choy, spinach, kale, watercress and mustard greens are particularly high in iron and calcium.

## Avoid

**Meat and poultry:** Beef, lamp, pork, veal, horse, organ meat, wild meat, chicken, turkey, goose, dick, quail, etc

**Fish and Seafood:** All types of fish. anchovies, shrimp, squid, scallops, calamari, mussels, crab, lobster, etc.

**Dairy:** Milk, yoghurt, chesse, butter, cream, ice cream, etc.

**Eggs:** From chickens, quails, ostriches, fish, etc.

**Bee products:** Honey, bee pollen, royal jelly, etc.

**Animal-based ingredient:** Whey, casein, lactose, egg white albumen, gelatin, cochineal or carmine, isinglass, shellac, L-cysteine, animal-derived vitamin D3 and fish-derived omega-3 fatty acids.

# Low-Carb

Low-carb diets have been popular for many decades, especially for weight loss.

There are several types of low-carb diets, but all of them involve limiting carb intake to 20- 150 grams of net carbs per day.

The primary aim of the diet is to force the body to use more fats for fuel, instead of using carbs as a main source of energy.

## How it works

Low-carb diets are based on eating unlimited amounts of protein and fat, while severely limiting your carb intake.

When carb intake is very low, fatty acids are moved into the blood and transported to the liver, where some of them are turned into ketones.

The body can then use fatty acids and ketones in the absence of carbs as its primary energy source.

## Weight loss

Numerous studies show low-carb diets are extremely helpful for weight loss, especially in overweight and obese individuals.

Low-carb diets seem to be very effective at reducing dangerous belly fat, which can become lodged around your organs.

People on very Iow-carb diets commonly reach a state called ketosis. Many studies have found that ketogenic diets lead to more than twice the weight loss of a low-fat, calorie-restricted diet.

## Other benefits

Low-carb diets tend to reduce your appetite and make you feel less hungry, leading to an automatic reduction in calorie intake.

Furthermore, low-carb diets may benefit many major disease risk factors, such as blood triglycerides, cholesterol levels,blood sugar levels, insulin levels and blood pressure.

## The downside

Low-carb diets do not suit everyone. Some may feel great on them, while others will feels miserable.

In extrmely rare cases, very low-carb diets can cause a serious condition called ketoacidosis.
This condition seems to be more common in lactating women and can be fatal if left untreated.

However, low-carb diets are safe for the majority of people.

## Eat

**Meat:** Beef, lamb, pork, chicken and others. Grass-fed is best.

**Fish:** Salmon, trout, haddock and many others. Wild-caught fish is best.
**Eggs:** Omega-3 enriched or pastured eggs are best.

**Vegetables:** Spinach, broccoli, cauliflower, carrots and many others.

**Fruits:** Apples, oranges, pears, blueberries, strawberries.

**Nuts and Seeds:** Almonds, walnuts, sunflower seeds, etc.

**High-Fat Dairy:** Cheese, butter, heavy cream, yoghurt.

**Fats and Oils:** Coconut oil, butter, lard, olive oil and cod fish liver oil.

## Avoid
**Sugar:** Soft drinks, fruit juices, agave, candy, ice cream and many others.

**Gluten Grains:** Wheat, spelt, barley and rye. Includes bread and pasta.

**Trans Fats:** "Hydrogenated" or "partially hydrogenated" oils.

**High Omega-6 Seed and Vegetable Oils:** Cottonseed, soybean, sunflower, grapeseed,
corn, safflower and canola oils.

**Artificial Sweeteners:** Aspartame, Saccharin, Sucralose, Cyclamates and Acesulfame Potassium. Use Stevia instead.

**"Diet" and "Low-Fat" Products:** Many dairy products, cereals, crackers, etc.

**Highly Processed Foods:** If it looks like it was made in a factory, don't eat it.

# Dukan

The Dukan diet is a high-protein, low-carb weight loss diet.

It's a low-calorie diet and can be split into four phases - tow weight loss phases and two maintenance phases.

How long you stay in each phase depends on how much weight you need to lose. Each phase has its own dietary pattern.

## How it works

The weight loss phases are primarily based on eating unlimited high-protein foods and mandatory oat bran.

The other phases involve adding non-starchy vegetables at first, then some cards and fat. Later on, there will be fewer and fewer "pure protein days" to maintain your new weight.

## Weight loss

One study showed that women following the Dukan diet ate about 1,000 calories and 100 grams of protein per day and lost an average of33 lbs (15 kg) in 8-10 weeks,

Also, many other studies have shown that high- protein, low-carb diets can have major weight loss benefits.

These include a higher metabolic rate, a decrease in the hunger hormone ghrelin and an increase in the fullness hormones GLP-1, PYY and CDC,

## Other benefits

There are no recorded benefits of the Dukan diet in the scientific literature.

## The downside

There is very little quality research available on the Dukan diet.

The Dukan diet limits both fat and carbs — strategy not based on science. On the contrary, consuming fat as part of a high- protein diet seems to increase metabolic rate, compared with both low-carb and low-fat diets.

Also, fast weight loss achieved by severe calorie restriction tends to cause significant muscle loss along with the fat loss,

The loss of muscle mass and severe calorie restriction may also cause the body to conserve energy, making it very easy to regain the weight after losing it.

## Foods to Include and Avoid

Each phase of the Dukan Diet has its own pattern. Here's what you're allowed to eat during each.

# Ultra Low-Fat

An ultra low-fat diet restricts the consumption of fat to under 10% of consumed calories, Generally, a low-fat diet provides around 30% of its calories as fat.

Many studies have shown that this diet is ineffective for weight loss in the long term.

Proponents of the ultra low-fat diet claim that traditional low-fat diets are not low-fat enough and fat intakes need to stay under 10% of total calories to produce health benefits and weight loss.


## How it works

An ultra low-fat diet contains 10% or fewer calories from fat. The diet is mostly plant-based and has a limited intake of animal products. Therefore, its generally very high in carbs (80%) and low in protein (10%).

## Weight loss

This diet has been shown to be very successful for weight loss among obese individuals. In one study, obese individuals lost an average of 140 lbs (63 kg) on an ultra low- fat diet termed the rice diet.

Another 8-week study with a diet containing 7- 14% fat showed an average weight loss of 14.8 lbs (6.7 kg).

## Other benefits

Studies have shown that ultra low-fat diets can improve several risk factors for heart disease, including high blood pressure, high cholesterol and markers of inflammation.

Surprisingly, this high-carb, low-fat diet can also lead to significant improvements in type 2 diabetics.

Furthermore, it may slow the progression of multiple sclerosis, an autoimmune disease that affects the brain, spinal cord and optic nerves in the eyes.

## The downside

The fat restriction may cause problems in the long-term, as fat has many important roles in the body.

These include helping build cell membranes and hormones and helping the body absorb fat-soluble vitamins.

Moreover, an ultra low-fat diet limits the intake of many healthy foods, lacks variety and is extremely hard to stick to.

## Cooking Tips

* Avoid deep fried foods.
* Trim visible fat off meats and remove the skin from poultry before cooking.
* Bake, broil, boil, poach or roast poultry, fish and lean meats.
* Drain and discard fat that drains out of meat as you cook it.
* Add little or no fat to foods.
* Use vegetable oil sprays to grease pans for cooking or baking.
* Steam vegetables.
* Use herbs or no-oil marinades to flavour
foods.


# Atkins

The Atkins diet is the most well-known low-carb weight loss diet.

Its proponents state that you can lose weight by eating as much protein and fat as you like, as long as you avoid carbs.

The main reason why low-carb diets are so effective for weight loss is that they reduce your appetite.

This causes you to eat fewer calories without having to think about it.

## How it works

The Atkins diet is split into four phases. It starts with an induction phase, during which you eat under 20 grams of carbs per day for two weeks.

The other phases involve slowly reintroducing healthy carbs back into your diet as you approach your goal weight.
## Weight loss

The Atkins diet has been studied extensively and shown to lead to faster weight loss than low-fat dots.

Other studies have shown that Iow-carb diets are very helpful for weight loss. They are especially successful in reducing belly fat, the most dangerous fat that lodges itself in the abdominal cavity.

## Other benefits

Numerous studies show low-carb diets, like the Atkins diet, may reduce many risk factors for disease, including blood triglycerides, cholesterol, blood sugar, insulin and blood pressure.

Compared to other weight loss diets, low-carb diets also show greater improvements in blood sugar, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides and other health markers.


## The downside

Same as with other very low-carb diets, the Atkins diet is safe and healthy for most people but may cause problems in rare cases.

## Eat

**Meats:** Beef, pork, Iamb, chicken, bacon and others.
**Fish and Seafood:** Salmon, trout, sardines, etc.

**Eggs:** The healthiest eggs are Omega-3 enriched or pastured.

**Low-garb vegetables:** Kale, spinach, broccoli, asparagus and others.

**Full-fat dairy:** Butter, cheese, cream, full-fat yoghurt.

**Nuts and Seeds:** Almonds, macadamia nuts, walnuts, sunflower seeds, etc.

**Healthy Fats:** Extra virgin olive oil, coconut oil,  avocados and avocado oil.

## Avoid

**Sugar:** Soft drinks, fruit juices, cakes, candy,
ice cream, etc.

**Grains:** Wheat, spelt, rye, barley, rice.

**Vegetable oils:** Soybean oil, corn oil,
cottonseed oil, canola oil and a few others.

**Trans fats:** Usually found in processed foods
with the word "hydrogenated" on the
ingredients list,

**"Diet" and "low-fat" foods:** These are
usually very high in sugar.

**High-carb vegetables:** Carrots, turnips, etc.

**High-carb fruits:** Bananas, apples, oranges, pears, grapes.

**Starches:** Potatoes, sweet potatoes,

**Legumes:** Lentils, beans, chickpeas, etc

# Zone

The zone diet is a low-glycemic load diet on which you limit carbs to 35-45% of daily calories and protein and fat to 30% each.

It recommends eating only carbs with a low glycemic load.

The glycemic load (GL) of a food is an estimate of how much a food will raise your blood glucose levels after eating it. It takes into account how many carbs are in the food and how much that amount will raise your blood glucose levels.

The Zone diet was initially developed to reduce diet-induced inflammation, cause weight loss and reduce the risk of developing chronic diseases.

## How it works

The Zone diet recommends balancing each meal with one-third protein, two-thirds colourful fruits and veggies and a dash of fat, namely monounsaturated oil such as olive oil, avocado or almonds.

It also says to limit the intake of high-GL carbs, such as bananas, rice and potatoes.

## Weight loss

Studies on the effects of a low-glycemic load diet on weight loss are rather inconsistent.

Some studies say the diet promotes weight loss and reduces appetite, while others only show a small weight loss, compared to other weight loss diets.

## Other benefits

The greatest benefit of this diet is a reduction in risk factors for heart disease, such as reduced cholesterol and triglycerides.

One study also showed that the Zone diet may improve blood sugar control, reduce waist circumference and reduce inflammation in overweight or obese individuals with type 2 diabetes.

## The downside

There are not many issues with this diet. The only thing to critizize is that im limits the consumption of some healthy carb sources, such as bananas and potatoes.

## Eat

### Protein :

* Skinless chicken and turkey breast
* Fish and shellfish
* Vegetarian protein, tofu, other soy products
* Egg whites
* Low-fat cheeses
* Low-fat milk and yoghurt

### Fat:

* Avocados
* Peanut butter
* Tahini
* Oils such as canola oil, sesame oil, peanut oil and olive oil
* Nuts, such as macadamia, peanuts, cashews, almonds or pistachios

### Garbs:
* Fruit such as berries, apples, oranges,
plums and more
* Vegetables such as cucumbers, peppers, spinach, tomatoes,  mushrooms, yellowsquash, chickpeas and more
* Grains, such as oatmeal and barley.

## Avoid
**High-sugar fruits:** Such as bananas, grapes, raisins, dried fruits and mangoes.

**High-sugar or starchy vegetables:** Like peas, corn, carrots and potatoes.

**Refined and processed carbs:** Bread, bagels, pasta, noodles and other white-flour products.

**Other processed foods:** Including breakfast cereals and muffins.

**Foods with added sugar:** Such as candy, cakes and cookies.

**Soft drinks:** Neither sugar-sweetened nor sugar-free drinks are recommended.

**Coffee and tea:** Keep these to a minimum, since water is the beverage of choice.

# Intermittent Fasting

Intermittent fasting is an eating pattern that cycles beween periods of fasting and eating.

Rather than restricting the foods you eat, it states when you should eat them.

Therefore, it can be seen as more of an eating pattern than a diet.

The most popular ways to do intermittent fasting are:

* **The 16/8 method:** Involves skipping
breaxtst and restricting your daily eating
period to 8 hours, subsequently fasting for
the remaining 16 hours of the day.
* **The eat-stop-eat method:** Involves 24-
hour fasts once or twice per week on non-
consecutive days.
* **The 5:2 diet:** On two non-consecutive
days of the week, you restrict your intake
to 500-600 calories. On the five
remaining days, you eat like normal.
* **The warrior diet:** Eat small amounts of
raw fruits and vegetables during the day
and one huge meal at night, basically
fasting during the day and feasting at night
within a 4-hour window.

## How it works

Intermittent fasting is commonly used for weight loss because it leads to relatively easy calorie restriction.

It can make you eat fewer calories overall, as long as you don't overcompensate by eating much more during the eating periods.

## Weight loss

Intermittent fasting is generally very successful for weight loss. It has been shown to cause weight loss of 3-8% over a period of 3-24 weeks, which is a lot compared to most weight loss studies.

In addition to causing less muscle loss than standard calorie restriction, it may increase your metabolic rate by 3.6-14% in the short-term

## Other benefits

Intermittent fasting may reduce markers of inflammation, cholesterol levels, blood triglycerides and blood sugar levels.

Furthermore, intermittent fasting has been linked to increased levels of human growth hormone, improved insulin sensitivity, improved cellular repair and altered gene expressions.

Animal studies also suggest that it may help new brain cells grow, lengthen lifespan and protect against Alzheimer's disease and cancer.

## The downside

Although intermittent fasting is safe for well-nourished and healthy people, it does not suit everyone. Some studies have shown it's not as beneficial for women as it is for men.

In addition, some people should avoid fasting.

This includes those sensitive to drops in blood sugar levels, pregnant women, breastfeeding moms, teenagers, children and people who are malnourished, underweight or nutrient deficient.

## Eat
Anything you want, just don't overdo it. The focus of this diet is not what you eat - but when you eat.
## Avoid
Nothing particular to avoid. Just use common sense and avoid the top, but don't go crazy on your non-fasting days.
